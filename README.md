## About The Project

**TasteMasters** is a comprehensive full-stack web application designed to simulate a complete catering business management system. This project allows customers to browse a food menu, place detailed orders, and request custom dishes. For administrators, it features a secure, role-based control panel to manage the entire food menu (CRUD), view and approve customer requests, and oversee the platform's content.

-----

## ‚ú® Key Features

  - **Secure User Authentication:** Signup, Login, and Logout functionality with secure password hashing.
  - **Dynamic Food Menu:** Customers can browse a dynamic menu of food items managed by the admin.
  - **Complete Ordering Workflow:** A multi-step process to select an item, review an order summary with dynamic price calculation, and simulate a checkout.
  - **Order History:** Logged-in users can view their past orders with all relevant details.
  - **Custom Order Request System:** A dedicated form for users to request items not on the menu, which are then sent to the admin for approval.
  - **Role-Based Admin Control Panel:** A secure admin area accessible only to users with the 'admin' role.
  - **Full Food Management (CRUD):** Admins have full **C**reate, **R**ead, **U**pdate, and **D**elete capabilities over the food menu.
  - **Request Approval System:** Admins can view and approve pending custom order requests from users.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

  - Python 3.8 or higher
  - **XAMPP** (to run the Apache and MySQL servers)

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository**

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/TasteMasters.git
    cd TasteMasters
    ```

2.  **Set Up a Virtual Environment**

    ```sh
    # Windows
    python -m venv venv && .\venv\Scripts\activate
    # macOS / Linux
    python3 -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies**
    *(Ensure you have a `requirements.txt` file by running `pip freeze > requirements.txt` if one doesn't exist)*

    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Configure the Database**

      - Start the **Apache** and **MySQL** modules from your XAMPP Control Panel.
      - Go to `http://localhost/phpmyadmin/`.
      - Create a new database named `catering_db`.
      - Go to the **Import** tab and import the `database.sql` file to set up the tables.

5.  **Configure Database Credentials**

      - Open the `app.py` file.
      - Locate the `app.config` section for MySQL and ensure the `MYSQL_USER` and `MYSQL_PASSWORD` match your local setup (for XAMPP, the default is user `'root'` with an empty password).

6.  **Run the Application**

    ```sh
    python app.py
    ```

    The site will be live at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

### Creating an Admin User

This application uses a role-based system. There are no default admin credentials. To create an admin:

1.  **Register** a new user on the website normally.
2.  Go to the `users` table in **phpMyAdmin**.
3.  Manually edit the new user's record and change their **`role`** from `'user'` to `'admin'`.
4.  Log out and log back in with that user's credentials. The "Admin Panel" link will now be visible.
